\section{Results}
\label{section:intra-particle}

Our multithreaded collision detection code runs a classic data decomposition
scheme on the triangles:
While the first triangle $T_i$ of $p_i$ is compared to the first triangle of $T_j$, we can simultaneously compare the second triangle. 
The concurrency scales in the number of triangles per particle.
Synchronisation points, i.e.~critical sections, are solely the insertion of
contact points into the result set.
