\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Many particle simulations today rely on spherical or analytical particle shape
descriptions.
They find non-spherical, triangulated particle models computationally
infeasible due to expensive collision detections.
We propose a hybrid collision detection algorithm based upon an iterative
solve of a minimisation problem that automatically falls back to a brute-force
comparison-based algorithm variant if the problem is ill-posed.
Such a hybrid can exploit the vector facilities of modern chips and it is
well-prepared for the arising manycore era.
Our approach pushes the boundary where non-analytical particle shapes
and the aligning of more accurate first principle physics become manageable.
