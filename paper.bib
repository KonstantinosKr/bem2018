	Abstract = {Fluidized beds are common in many industrial applications, including many in the chemical processing and energy industries. The design and operation of these beds can be challenging due to the complexity of the processes and limited ability for direct observation and measurement within the bed. Numerical simulations can reveal many behavior within fluidized beds, and allow insight into design or operating variation prior to testing. Among the defining characteristics of a fluidized bed, particle size distribution is known to be important to the behavior of these reactors. For example, moderate increase in fraction of small size particles, fines, can lead to better performance, while excessive fine content can increase inter-particle forces and degrade performance. This paper introduces .a numerical method for simulating industrial scale reactors involving particles with large size distribution and reports the results for large-scale parallel simulations of a fluidized bed. The approach is with Discrete Element Method fully coupled with fluid flow model using STAR-CCM+ software developed by CD-adapco. Our method builds on earlier work introducing the DEM coarse grain model (Sakai, et al., 2010) introducing features to facilitate simulation of poly-disperse particles and allowing distribution of particle size scaling factors. Results for simulating more than 108 particles with bimodal size distribution are analyzed and compared with theoretical predictions and results reported in the literature. This generalized coarse grain model is seen to achieve a balance between accuracy and speed to enable practical design and scale-up.},

	Abstract = {Grain kernels are finite and discrete materials. Although flowing grain can behave like a continuum fluid at times, the discontinuous behavior exhibited by grain kernels cannot be simulated solely with conventional continuum-based computer modeling such as finite-ele-ment or finite-difference methods. The discrete element method (DEM) is a proven numerical method that can model discrete particles like grain kernels by tracking the motion of individual particles. DEM has been used extensively in the field of rock mechanics. Its application is gaining popularity in grain postharvest operations, but it has not been applied widely. This paper reviews existing applications of DEM in grain postharvest operations. Published literature that uses DEM to simulate postharvest processing is reviewed, as are applications in handling and processing of grain such as soybean, corn, wheat, rice, rapeseed, and the grain coproduct distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Simulations of grain drying that involve particles in both free-flowing and confined-flow conditions are also included. Review of the existing liter-ature indicates that DEM is a promising approach in the study of the behavior of deformable soft particulates such as grain and coproducts, and it could benefit from the development of improved particle models for these com-plex-shaped particles.},

	Abstract = {Locomotion over deformable substrates is a common occurrence in nature. Footprints represent sedimentary distortions that provide anatomical, functional, and behavioral insights into trackmaker biology. The interpretation of such evidence can be challenging, however, particularly for fossil tracks recovered at bedding planes below the originally exposed surface. Even in living animals, the complex dynamics that give rise to footprint morphology are obscured by both foot and sediment opacity, which conceals animal-substrate and substrate-substrate interactions. We used X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM) to image and animate the hind limb skeleton of a chicken-like bird traversing a dry, granular material. Foot movement differed significantly from walking on solid ground; the longest toe penetrated to a depth of approximately 5 cm, reaching an angle of 30 degrees below horizontal before slipping backward on withdrawal. The 3D kinematic data were integrated into a validated substrate simulation using the discrete element method (DEM) to create a quantitative model of limb-induced substrate deformation. Simulation revealed that despite sediment collapse yielding poor quality tracks at the air-substrate interface, subsurface displacements maintain a high level of organization owing to grain-grain support. Splitting the substrate volume along "virtual bedding planes" exposed prints that more closely resembled the foot and could easily be mistaken for shallow tracks. DEM data elucidate how highly localized deformations associated with foot entry and exit generate specific features in the final tracks, a temporal sequence that we term "track ontogeny." This combination of methodologies fosters a synthesis between the surface/layer-based perspective prevalent in paleontology and the particle/volume-based perspective essential for a mechanistic understanding of sediment redistribution during track formation.},

	Abstract = {Although granular materials have always been an important part of our everyday life, their characteristics and behavior is still only rudimentally understood. Therefore the numerical simulation has gained an increasing importance to gain deeper insight into the properties of granular media. One simulation approach is rigid body dynamics. In contrast to particle-based approaches, it fully resolves the granular particles as geometric objects and incorporates frictional contact dynamics. However, due to its complexity and the lack of large-scale parallelization, rigid body dynamics so far could not be used for very large simulation scenarios.   In this paper we demonstrate massively parallel granular media simulations by means of a parallel rigid body dynamics algorithm. We will validate the algorithm for granular gas simulations and prove its scalability on up to 131?072 processor cores. Additionally, we will show several parallel granular material simulations both with spherical and non-spherical granular particles.},

@article{Jiang2005,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel two-dimensional (2D) discrete model for granular materials with rolling resistance. The salient features of our formulation are: it consists of a geometrically derived kinematical model, physically based mechanical contact models and locally equilibrated equations governing the motion of the rigid particles; only one additional parameter $\delta$ needs to be introduced in the model when compared with the standard discrete element method (DEM). In the study, precise definitions of pure sliding and pure rolling were proposed, and a decomposition of a general contact displacement was given in terms of these rolling and sliding components which are then linked to energy dissipation. The standard DEM assumption that grains are in contact at discrete points was here replaced by the assumption that grains are in contact over a width. By making the idealization that the grain contact width is continuously distributed with normal/tangential basic elements, we established a rolling contact model together with normal/tangential contact models, and also related the governing equations to local equilibrium. As an example of its application, the present model was incorporated into a DEM code to study the angle of internal friction ? of the material. Fifty-four DEM simulations showed that ? predicted by the novel model was increased in comparison to the standard DEM prediction, and may be closer to the values observed experimentally provided that the $\delta$?? relationship established in this paper was used.},

	Abstract = {Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs) experienced mobility problems during traverses. Three-dimensional discrete element method (DEM) simulations of MER wheel mobility tests for wheel slips of i = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 0.99 were done to examine high wheel slip mobility to improve the ARTEMIS MER traverse planning tool. Simulations of wheel drawbar pull and sinkage MIT data for i ? 0.5 were used to determine DEM particle packing density (0.62) and contact friction (0.8) to represent the simulant used in mobility tests. The DEM simulations are in good agreement with MIT data for i = 0.5 and 0.7, with reasonable but less agreement at lower wheel slip. Three mobility stages include low slip (i {\textless} 0.3) controlled by soil strength, intermediate slip (i ? 0.3-0.6) controlled by residual soil strength, and high slip (i {\textgreater} 0.6) controlled by residual soil strength and wheel sinkage depth. Equilibrium sinkage occurred for i {\textless} 0.9, but continuously increased for i = 0.99. Improved DEM simulation accuracy of low-slip mobility can be achieved using polyhedral particles, rather than tri-sphere particles, to represent soil. The DEM simulations of MER wheel mobility can improve ARTEMIS accuracy.},

	Abstract = {The contact between particles is an important task in simulating the behaviour of particle assemblies. Conventionally, the dissipative contribution to the normal contact force is described by viscoelastic damping, where the concept of the constant coefficient of restitution (COR) is extensively explored in Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. From the previous studies it is known that different models provide different time-histories during the contact even for the equal values of the COR. In the present investigation, a comparative study of various nonlinear damping models for spherical particles is given on the basis of dimensional analysis. The research aims to demonstrate how the differences observed in a single particle collision contribute to the collective behaviour of particles in multi-particle systems and thereby affect the sensitivity of DEM results for various damping models. The selected samples of 3D granular flows have been solved numerically to illustrate the contribution of the damping models to the dynamic behaviour during the impact. The current report presents the results obtained in studying the behaviour of particles during the filling of a hopper, the discharge and the motion of the particles on the bottom-plane of a rectangular box. Moreover, the most popular nonlinear damping models reported by Lee and Herrmann, Brilliantov, Tsuji and modified Tsuji models have been examined. The results of the present study allow us to define basic tendencies observed, when various models are applied.},

Any improvements on the efficiency of the collision detection module may have a great impact on the overall per- formance of these applications.

Efficiently exploiting SIMD vector units is one of the most important aspects in achieving high performance of the application code running on Intel{\textregistered} Xeon Phi? coprocessors. In this paper, we present several effective SIMD vectorization techniques such as less-than-full-vector loop vectorization, Intel{\textregistered} MIC specific alignment optimization, and small matrix transpose/multiplication 2-D vectorization implemented in the Intel{\textregistered} C/C++ and Fortran production compilers for Intel{\textregistered} Xeon Phi? coprocessors. A set of workloads from several application domains is employed to conduct the performance study of our SIMD vectorization techniques.

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region, The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently-those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly, They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers-the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Gray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems, for large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Gray C90 processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The present paper studies two particle management strategies for dynamically adaptive Cartesian grids at hands of a particle-in-cell code. One holds the particles within the grid cells, the other within the grid vertices. The fundamental challenge for the algorithmic strategies results from the fact that particles may run through the grid without velocity constraints. To facilitate this, we rely on multiscale grid representations. They allow us to lift and drop particles between different spatial resolutions. We call this cell-based strategy particle in tree (PIT). Our second approach assigns particles to vertices describing a dual grid (PIDT) and augments the lifts and drops with multiscale linked cells. Our experiments validate the two schemes at hands of an electrostatic particle-in-cell code by retrieving the dispersion relation of Langmuir waves in a thermal plasma. They reveal that different particle and grid characteristics favour different realisations. The possibility that particles can tunnel through an arbitrary number of grid cells implies that most data is exchanged between neighbouring ranks, while very few data is transferred non-locally. This constraints the scalability as the code potentially has to realise global communication. We show that the merger of an analysed tree grammar with PIDT allows us to predict particle movements among several levels and to skip parts of this global communication a priori. It is capable to outperform several established implementations based upon trees and/or space-filling curves.},
